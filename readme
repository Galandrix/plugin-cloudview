This Roundcube Plugin will let you have the option to view and edit documents,
spreadsheets, presentations and images in the browser itself. This one click
solution gives you a huge advantage over the traditional way of doing it:
downloading the document from Roundcube, saving it, launching a office
application to open it.

## Installing and Activating cloudview ##

After downloading a cloudview, extract (unzip) it in RoundCube's plugins directory.
Doing this correctly should result in a subdirectory "plugins/cloudview" which contains
all of the plugin's files.

Enable it by adding its directory name to the config option plugins,
as an array element. Editing your local "config/main.inc.php" file and
add "cloudview" to the "$rcmail_config['plugins']" array.

$rcmail_config['plugins'] = array('cloudview');

To disable cloudview, just remove it from the list. 

Get your Zoho API Key from: http://writer.zoho.com/apikey.htm
and add it to your "plugins/cloudviw/config.inc.php" file.
